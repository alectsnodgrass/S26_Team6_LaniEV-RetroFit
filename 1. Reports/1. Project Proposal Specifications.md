# Project Proposal

## Introduction
This project aims to develop and characterize a standardized retrofit kit that converts conventional electric golf cars to solar-charged LiFePO₄ battery-powered golf cars. A Tennessee Technological University Club Car will be retrofitted with a solar-charging panel and LiFePO₄ battery provided by LaniEV. Corresponding documentation, analysis, and characterization of the conversion will support Lani's commercialization of these retrofit kits. During the retrofitting of the golf car, challenges may arise from the pre-existing condition of the golf car, as it was modified by a previous capstone project. The project will also analyze the effectiveness of Lani's retrofit kit compared to existing solutions.

In today’s world, many of the luxuries people use are powered by non-renewable sources. Over the last decade, there has been increasing concern over the lack of non-renewable resources and their effects on the global environment. Whether or not fossil fuel consumption correlates to atmospheric carbon dioxide percentage or global climate is irrelevant to the fact that there is increased demand for technologies that harness renewable energy sources. In response, scientists and engineers are formulating ways to replace non-renewable power sources with renewable ones. One of the leading emitters of carbon dioxide is motor vehicles, and thus, modes of transportation are a huge focus for renewable resource technologies. Although companies have produced cars that run on electricity, these cars require constant recharging, which is achieved through conventional, large-scale power generation. In turn, this puts an added load on power companies to increase output to sustain the increased demand. LaniEV is actively addressing this area of focus by both producing solar-powered vehicles and developing technologies that convert legacy electric systems to solar-powered.

## Formulating the Problem
### Background
#### Customer
This project's primary customer is Lani Solar, LLC (LaniEV). LaniEV is developing a line of standardized retrofit conversion kits for low-speed electric vehicles (LSVs), personal transport vehicles (PVTs),  and golf cars. These retrofit kits replace the legacy lead-acid battery with a LiFePO₄ (Lithium Iron Phosphate) battery bank integrated with a self-charging roof solar panel. The goal is to commercialize the conversion kits for entire fleet conversions. Secondary stakeholders include Tennessee Technological University (TTU), as the owner of the control golf car used for the project, and as the ensuring agency for documented safety, reliability, and performance data. Dr. Christopher Storm Johnson is responsible, as the capstone instructor, for evaluating team performance and ensuring the project's desired end-state is reached. Prospective fleet operators and other consumers of the retrofit kit would depend heavily on the testing and evaluations done on the product. 

#### Problem
Legacy golf cars continue to utilize lead-acid battery systems due to their well-documented electrical performance and broad availability. These systems present constraints such as low energy density, volume constraints, short lifecycle, load limits, maintenance requirements, and environmental concerns. These limitations increase cost and decrease sustainability for large-scale applications. Alternative power systems, such as LiFePO₄ batteries integrated with solar charging, could potentially address the limitations inherent in the lead-acid batteries. The growing interest in alternative systems demands formal documentation for conversion processes. The lack of validation prevents large-scale migration of LSV, PVT, and golf car platforms to alternative energy systems.

#### Solution 
Meticulous examination and documentation of the conversion process shall establish a validated framework for implementing the standardized retrofit kit. The development includes initial state characterization of the existing lead-acid system, formalization of the conversion methodology, post-conversion performance evaluation, and a quantified analysis of environmental and economic impact. The Tennessee Tech University Club Car shall serve as the control platform for this process. Baseline electrical and functional characteristics of the legacy system shall be documented prior to conversion. Following installation of the LiFePO₄ battery and solar charging systems, the vehicle shall undergo structured testing to quantify energy efficiency, power delivery, charging behavior, and operational performance. The resulting documentation shall provide the necessary metrics required for the retrofit kit to be commercialized. 

#### Challenges
The transition from a legacy lead-acid battery system to a LiFePO₄ solar-integrated architecture introduces several technical challenges that require analysis and validation. Power system analysis is required to ensure electrical compatibility between the new battery management system, solar charge component, and existing drivetrain components. Reliable baseline and post-conversion measurements require appropriate instrumentation and data acquisition to produce a repeatable performance comparison. System modeling is necessary to interpret data and support cost and environmental impact projections. In addition, testing and documentation must be developed to establish a repeatable retrofit framework rather than an installation-specific modification.

#### Alternatives
The response to lead-acid battery degradation in golf cars has been, primarily, to replace the old battery with a new lead-acid battery. This approach minimizes integration complexity but does not address limitations related to energy density, cycle life, or environmental impact. A secondary alternative involves replacing the lead-acid battery bank with a LiFePO₄ system while preserving the grid-based charging. Although this method reduces maintenance requirements, it does not incorporate renewable energy or provide documented lifecycle comparisons. A less compact solution, still matching the footprint of the retrofit kit, would be the construction of a solar farm to fuel charging stations for golf cars. While a solar farm is less effective for small vehicles, it allows for more diverse applications of solar energy. Additional alternatives include full vehicle replacement or commercially available conversion kits. However, these options often lack formally documented integration procedures, validated performance data, and/or economic or environmental lifecycle analysis.

#### Constraints:

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders. Several regulatory bodies may govern aspects of this solution.

- **The National Electrical Code (NEC), Article 690:**
    - Sets standards for solar photovoltaic systems and applies to the electrical integration of the solar panel, charge controller, and associated wiring. Additionally, compliance with applicable UL-listed components may be required for safety certification. If the golf car is intended for use on public roads or pathways, local Department of Motor Vehicles regulations or municipal ordinances may also apply [1].

- **OSHA Regulations (29 CFR 1910):**
    - Govern safe practices during live testing and assembly to protect team members working with electrical systems, including lockout/tagout (1910.147) and electrical safety-related work practices (1910 Subpart S) [2], [3].

- **American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards:**
    - Applicable ANSI standards govern electrical safety labeling, wiring methods, and equipment performance [4]. For example, ANSI Z535 addresses safety signage and labeling requirements and applies to high-voltage warnings and battery hazard markings. ANSI electrical performance standards may also be referenced with UL and IEEE requirements.

- **Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Certification:**
    - Components such as charge controllers, DC-DC converters, battery management systems (BMS), and wiring assemblies may require compliance with relevant UL standards (e.g., UL 1741 for inverters and controllers, UL 1973 for stationary batteries, UL 2580 for electric vehicle battery systems) [5]. Use of UL-listed components reduces liability exposure and supports insurability.

- **SAE International Standards:**
    - May apply to the electrical integration of auxiliary power systems into electric vehicles. Standards such as SAE J2344 (EV battery system safety) and SAE J1772 (EV conductive charging interface, if applicable) provide guidance on safe and predictable operation across environmental conditions. Adhering to these standards supports interoperability and safety compliance [6].

- **IEEE Standards:**

For example, IEEE 1547 governs the interconnection of distributed energy resources (if grid interaction is considered), and IEEE grounding practices may inform chassis bonding and fault protection design.

- **National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards:**
    - NFPA 70 (NEC) governs electrical installations. NFPA 70E addresses electrical safety in the workplace and may apply during testing and live diagnostics. NFPA 855 may apply if energy storage systems exceed certain capacity thresholds. [8]

- **Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS):**
    - If the vehicle is classified for on-road use, certain FMVSS requirements may apply, particularly regarding lighting, braking systems, and electrical safety integration for low-speed vehicles (LSVs).

- **EPA and Environmental Regulations:**
    - Battery disposal, recycling, and material handling must comply with applicable EPA hazardous waste regulations and state-level environmental rules governing lithium-based battery systems.

- **Social Considerations:**
    - This solution democratizes access to reliable electric transportation in areas lacking adequate electrical infrastructure, with implications for rural or developing communities where golf carts serve practical transportation roles beyond recreation. The increasing cultural acceptance of solar and sustainable energy technologies supports market viability [9].

## Survey of Existing Solutions

### Methods of Powering a Golf Car
There are multiple existing solutions for powering a golf car. The oldest is the gas-powered golf car, which uses a combustion engine to propel the vehicle. According to Grand View Research (2024), gas-powered models account for approximately 24.6% of the global golf car market, while electric models make up the remaining 75.4% [10]. Electric-powered golf cars are now the most prevalent in the industry and are suitable for various charging methods. The most common method is to connect the battery to an outlet that feeds off the main power grid, which is powered by many sources, such as natural gas, renewables, nuclear, coal, and others. An alternative approach is to incorporate renewable energy sources directly into the vehicle, such as installing a solar panel on the roof of the golf car. Throughout the day, the panels can continuously charge the battery, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective option for vehicle power, especially in sunnier regions.

#### **Table 1:** Comparison of golf cars
| Charging Type | Cost | Lifespan | Charge Time | Maintenance |
|---------------|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Gas | $10,000–$13,000 | 20–30 years | few Minutes | High |
| Electric | $9,000–$11,000 | 10–15 years | 8–12 hours | Low |
| Renewable (Solar) | Electric base cost + $300–$700 solar | Solar panels: 20–25 years, batteries: 8–20 years | Continuous charge in sunlight | Very Low |

Data compiled from [11], [12], [13].

### Battery Technologies
There are several types of batteries used to power golf cars. Among new vehicles being sold today, lithium-ion batteries are the most popular. Across the existing, current fleets, however, lead-acid batteries are the most common due to decades of older cars remaining in service. There are three kinds of lead-acid batteries: flooded, gel, and absorbed glass mat (AGM). Flooded batteries are the most affordable and widely used, but they require regular maintenance, including checking water levels and cleaning terminals. Gel batteries use a silica-based gel electrolyte, providing excellent deep-cycle performance, resistance to extreme temperatures, and maintenance-free operation; however, they are more expensive and have specific charging requirements. AGM batteries use fiberglass mats to absorb the electrolyte, making them spill-proof, vibration-resistant, and lower-maintenance than flooded batteries while retaining similar sealed advantages [14], [15]. Nickel-based batteries are another option, though they never gained a significant foothold in the golf car market. While nickel-based batteries found success in hybrid vehicles and power tools, golf car manufacturers largely skipped over them, moving directly from lead-acid to lithium-ion batteries [16]. The table below summarizes the key characteristics of these battery types.

#### **Table 2:** Comparison of Golf Car Batteries
|Battery Type | Full Set Cost (2026) | Lifespan | Charge Time | Maintenance |
|-------------|----------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
|Flooded Lead-Acid | $800–$1,500 | 4–6 years | 8–12 hrs | High |
|Gel Lead-Acid | $1,000–$1,800 | 5–7 years | 8–10 hrs | Low |
|AGM Lead-Acid | $1,200–$2,000 | 5–7 years | 6–8 hrs |  Low |
|Lithium (LiFePO4) | $2,000–$5,000 | 10–20 years | 2–4 hrs | None |
|Nickel-Metal Hydride | $1,800–$3,500 | 5–8 years | 8–12 hrs |  Medium |
Data compiled from [14], [15], [16].

## Measures of Success
The success of the project will be evaluated based on the documentation and analysis of the conversion process, the characterization of the pre and post conversion golf car, and the analysis of the environmental and economic impact. The following criteria define the expected outcomes of the project and metrics of the converted golf car.

### Documentation
The team shall document the entire engineering process of installing the retrofit kit provided by LaniEV. The team shall also produce multiple deliverables that help LaniEV characterize the performance of their product. The required deliverables (reports, models, extrapolations, assessments, analysis, logs, data, manuals, etc.) broadly fall into the following categories.

        1. Characterize the initial state of the vehicle
        2. Document the conversion process and methodology
        3. Measure and analyze the net performance of the vehicle post-conversion
        4. Quantify the environmental impact
        5. Quantify the economic impact

Creating experiments and methodologies to verify the system's specifications is the main objective of this project. The reliability, repeatability, and thoroughness of the documents produced will be used to measure the success of the project. 

### Functional Capability
The electric golf car shall demonstrate full functional operation, including propulsion, steering, braking, and control subsystems, without mechanical or electrical failure during normal use.

### Aesthetic and User Appeal
The car shall exhibit a clean and professional appearance, with enclosed wiring, acceptable noise levels, and minimal cosmetic defects, in order to meet consumer expectations.

## Resources

### Budget
This project involves replacing the roof and battery of an existing golf car with a solar charging battery and solar roof provided by LaniEV. One requirement is to document the initial state of the golf car, which includes how the initial lead-acid battery operates. Currently, there is no battery to fulfil this, so the team will need to buy a new set of batteries to use. Also, when installing the new battery into the golf car, some components such as wires and plug terminals may need to be replaced. To replace the components and fully retrofit the car, electrical, mechanical, and other specific tools or equipment may need to be purchased or borrowed. 

#### **Table 3:** Estimated Budget
| Item                | Estimated Cost | Purchase Funding   |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Lead-acid batteries | $1,000         | Possibly LaniEV    |
| Equipment           | $200           | Team 6             |
| Parts               | $200           | Team 6             |

### Timeline
![Retrofit Kit Project Gantt Chart](./Gantt_chart.png)


## Specific Implications 
This project provides LaniEV with actionable data, standardized procedures, and a documented application that supports the development of a retrofit kit for converting existing electric golf cars to solar power. It also serves as a reference for future evaluations or conversions of similar golf cars by documenting the pre-conversion features of the TTU Club Car and following a structured conversion process. Documentation of the conversion includes battery removal, LiFePO₄ installation, wiring changes, and solar roof installation. This establishes standard procedures that support large-scale conversions. The project includes analysis of energy use, charging behavior, and "fill versus drain" rates. This verified data allows for an objective comparison between old lead-acid systems and the LiFePO₄ solar-integrated system. The resulting performance metrics enhance product credibility and support its large-scale adoption. 

The project also gives LaniEV an analysis of environmental and economic impacts. Comparisons between the pre-conversion and post-conversion golf cars will highlight measurable differences like landfill waste, stress on the electrical grid, carbon footprint, and return on investment. The findings from these comparisons could apply to larger fleet adoption and improve LaniEV's chances of engaging big organizations. Overall, the project builds the technical analysis required for new electric technology and provides LaniEV with an honest, analytical assessment of the retrofit kit.

## Broader Implications, Ethics, and Responsibility as Engineers
The development of a retrofitting kit that enables legacy electric vehicle systems to transfer to solar-powered systems carries various consequences. It is the responsibility of the engineers to consider the implications of introducing a system and ensure that the product functions as intended. Public safety, environmental impact, economic impact, and product integrity are all necessary considerations in the development of new technology such as this retrofit kit. 

### Global Impacts:
The development of a solar-integrated golf car retrofit kit influences energy infrastructure, supply chains, and the broader pursuit of renewable power in transportation systems. The decentralization of energy reliance reduces the strain on the local power grid and demonstrates the feasibility of solar-reliant transportation systems. This specific system will increase the demand for materials such as lithium, iron, phosphate, silicon, and aluminum. The overarching accomplishment of this system is an advancement towards renewable energy technologies. 

### Economic Impacts:
A solar-powered golf car that is affordable and efficient would increase demand for the materials and components required to produce this technology. Increased demand for solar panels and batteries drives an increase in mining, refining, processing, and shipping industries, particularly for materials such as lithium, nickel, graphite, glass, aluminum, and silicon. The increased demand would produce a growing labor market and create new jobs, especially in countries that are rich in these materials.

### Environmental Impacts:
The environmental impacts of the solar-powered golf car could be seen in two different ways: large-scale and small-scale. On a larger scale, an increase in pollution and emissions would be created from the increase in mining, refining, and shipping operations, as well as the materials thrown out at the end of life. On a smaller scale, the areas that would see an increase in the use of these vehicles would experience cleaner air and less local pollution. There would also be significantly less noise pollution in areas that use golf cars, because electric vehicles tend to run much quieter than gas-powered cars. 

### Societal Impacts: 
On a societal level, there would be an increase in intellectual innovations regarding the technologies used by such vehicles. This would include the desire to create solar panels and batteries that are more efficient. Large-scale research and investments would lead us into battery systems and energy conversion technologies. Sustainable and affordable means of personal micro-transportation would improve mobility for elderly or disabled people.

### Potential Negatives:
The environmental issues that would arise from the increased excavation of materials required for batteries and corresponding solar panels are no small problem. An increase in hazardous waste would be produced by the increased demand for rare minerals. As there is currently no well-established method to recycle lithium-ion batteries, the end-of-life batteries become a hazard. Mitigations to these problems would be to choose battery chemistries that would have a reduction in constrained materials, properly inform customers as to how to properly dispose of used batteries, and improve the infrastructure that could repurpose the batteries.

### Ethical Considerations:
As engineers developing a solar-powered golf car, it is important to create a solar-powered golf car that is not only safe, but also high-quality and honest. All designs and specifications must adhere to legal safety standards. It is important that the customer always understands both the positives and negatives. It is necessary to list any specifications regarding safety as well as limitations regarding the product's range or efficiency, so as to reduce the number of injuries or unhappy customers. It is imperative not to exaggerate the golf car's capabilities, especially in non-ideal conditions.
